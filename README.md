### About LIFLENZ

LIFELENZ is a rapidly growing team of 70+ mathematicians, engineers, designers, and computer scientists based in the US and Australia building a machine learning-based, advanced analytics workforce, and human capital management platform. We have built and maintained over 20+ platforms over 19 years. We have won many awards for client delivery and collectively contributed to over 100+ global patents for complex software platforms. Our Founder has built three companies, achieving two highly successful exits. LIFELENZ is next. 
LIFELENZ is an automated platform solving challenges related to sales and labor forecasting, optimized scheduling, communications, and real-time shift running. The solution is aimed at the future workforce and initially at industries with a large number of part-time workers, hourly/shift workers, and contractors. We have existing clients in Quick Service Restaurants, Casual Dining, Retail, and Manufacturing and we're now also working with Hospitals & Hospitality companies. The long-term vision of LIFELENZ is to create a more efficient market for the future workforce

### Project Goal and Description
The Platform creates forecasts on sales, transactions, and other factors that drive labor demand.  The forecasts are created at a 15-minute level, and those forecasts are then translated into a labor demand target that needs to be staffed.  This includes the roles that will be necessary to meet the demand.  The system also has several screens that allow the users to configure the LIFELENZ platform to their business.
There are two sub-projects that we are looking to gain information from as part of this effort.  One is focused on understanding and being able to predict how the LIFELENZ platform is being used by employees of our clients, that is understanding the path through the LIFELENZ platform, the challenges and things that block their use of the platform, as well as how the usage differs by levels within the organization and how the usage changes over time.  In the end, we want to be able to predict usage levels to understand the demand for resources and how that may change over time.
The second sub-project incorporates how the crews using the employee application on their phone respond to automated optimized scheduling (AOS) that is created without human input.  Do people drop shifts, swap shifts, “no-show”, arrive late, more if the schedule is machine-made versus human-made?  What other factors are affecting behavioral differences?
Analyses do not have to be limited to the questions below.  If someone has additional ideas that provide insight, feel free to exercise your creativity and insight to do so.

### Potential Analytical Questions
Looking at stores that have run AOS schedules for certain weeks versus stores that are scheduled not using AOS, how do employees’ behavior differ between the two groups?  
1. Are there more swaps by the crew during weeks when schedules were created using AOS?
2. Are there more drops by the crew during weeks when schedules were created using AOS?
3. Are there more late arrivals by the crew during weeks when running schedules using AOS?
4. Are there more no-shows by the crew during weeks when running schedules using AOS?
5. How do the above differ by the experience level of the crew?
6. How do the above differ by day of the week?
7. How do the above differ by day-parts?
